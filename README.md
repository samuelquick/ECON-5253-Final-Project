# ECON-5253-Final-Project

### Data Recreation

NB: To retreive the data that I used for this project, you will need to utilize two APIs. The first is from the Energy Information Association and the other is from the St. Louis Federal Reserve. In both instances you will need to have a personalized key provided by each website. Note: Both websites asked that I not share mine, so you simply have to just import yout key where stated.





### Software Required

# ECON-5253-Final-Project

### Data Recreation

To retrieve my data and recreate my results that I used and received for this project, you will need to utilize two APIs. The first is from the Energy Information Association and the other is from the St. Louis Federal Reserve. In both instances you will need to have a personalized key provided by each website. 
Note: Both websites asked that I not share mine, so you simply have to just import your key where stated.

* Simply download code file, input personal keys where applicable, and run code to recreate results. Easy as cake.
* To change the lag order, just change the number in this line of code when you see it: "grangertest(x, z, order = 2)".




### Software Required
(I did not use all of these library packages, though I loaded all that I thought might be useful)

* library(EIAdata)
* library(tidyverse)
* library(data.table)
* library(GGally)
* library(plotly)
* library(rvest)
* library(stringr)
* library(magrittr)
* library(corrplot)
* library(lmtest)
* library(fredr)
* library(stargazer)
* library(xtable)

I hope you enjoy!
